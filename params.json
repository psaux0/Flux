{"name":"Flux","tagline":"Open Style Lab Team Dennis Project","body":"##Flux\r\n**Flux** is an open-source functional shirt designed for body temperature regulating. It is generated at **Open Style Lab** in summer 2014 by a team made of a designer, an engineer and an occupational therapist. Currently Flux is still under development.\r\n\r\n![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psaux0/Flux/master/pgdemo.PNG) \r\n\r\n###Features\r\n- Automatic temperature regulating\r\n- Remote temperature monitoring\r\n- Universal designed web application\r\n- Android App (under development)\r\n\r\n###Software Dependencies\r\n> #####Server Side (for web application)\r\nWeb server is written in Python. To communicate with microcontroller, we use [PySerial](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/). Web server application is built on light weight framework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). \r\n> #####Microcontroller\r\nThere are two versions of Flux right now. Flux 1.0 is based on Arduino Uno, so there won't be additional dependencies on microcontroller side. Flux 1.1 is based on ATtiny45/85. To program AVR microcontroller, AVR studio is necessary.\r\n> #####Android App\r\nIf you want to modify or contribute to the Android App, we would suggest you use the Eclipse IDE for Android. Android with version over 4.4 is needed for building this app.\r\n> #####PCB Design\r\nAll PCBs were designed in Eagle 6.4. In order to find all the components we used, you need install Adafruit and Sparfun eagle libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<center>Flux at Open Style Lab 2014.
